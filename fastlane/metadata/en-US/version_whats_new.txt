Hi all!

First, thanks to everyone for all of your feedback and comments. We have been working hard to fix bugs and your feedback has been extremely helpful to us. Please continue to leave reviews - we are reading them!

Second, we started an FAQ for our app here: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/FAQ. Check it out if you have questions.

Third, as you may of noticed, we are also releasing more frequent updates. We want to make sure we get fixes out to everyone as fast as possible. Reading your reviews doesn’t do us much good if we don’t ship our fixes!
