   Just before section html is sent across the bridge to the web view, add
   section identifiers around each section. This will make it easy to
   identify section offsets for the purpose of scrolling the web view to a
   given section. Do not save this html to the core data store - this way
   it can be changed later if necessary (to a div etc).
