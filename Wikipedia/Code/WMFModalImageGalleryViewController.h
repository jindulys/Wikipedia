/**
 *  Provides a scrollable gallery of high-resolution images and their associated metadata.
 *
 *  This class is intended to provide a consistent, modal gallery experience for any source of images. It does this with:
 *
 *  * Using a paging collection view to allow users to swipe though items
 *
 *  * Using special collection view cells (see @c WMFImageGalleryCollectionViewCell)
 *
 *  * Overlaying a "chrome" UI on top of the collection view (close button & top gradient)
 *
 *  * Interacting with its @c dataSource at specific points to allow for display of placeholder images, and elegantly
 *    updating cells when metadata and higher-resolution images are available.
