/**
 *  Collection of methods for applying a "cropping" effect to an image inside a @c UIImageView by modifying its
 *  @c contentsRect.  Modifying the @c contentsRect effectively windows the image set in the receiver, allowing us
 *  to effectively implement our own content modes without subclassing or overriding @c drawRect:.
 *
 *  @note All of these methods take an @c image parameter because the image should be set in a separate call.
 *        Otherwise there could be unexpected scaling/cropping transitions after the image is set.
