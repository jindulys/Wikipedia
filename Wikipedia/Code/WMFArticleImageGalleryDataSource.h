/**
 *  Base data source for galleries which display images in an article.
 *
 *  This class has a few responsibilities which are required to display article images in a gallery:
 *
 *  <h4>Collapsing variants in the gallery</h4>
 *
 *  Populates the collection view with distinct instances of the images in the article. In other words, uses
 *  @c uniqueArticleImages to get a unique list of images in their original order.  The images displayed in the gallery
 *  are the largest variants of each image (e.g. any additional entries extracted from srcset).
 *
 *  <h4>Empty View</h4>
 *
 *  Provides an "empty view" of the articles lead image (or thumbnail) if there aren't any images (e.g. if the article
 *  was just a preview whose data hasn't been downloaded yet).
 *
 *  <h4>RTL Handling</h4>
 *
 *  This class also implements RTL handling by reversing the items as needed.
