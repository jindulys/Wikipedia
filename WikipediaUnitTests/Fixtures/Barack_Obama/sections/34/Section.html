<p>Obama is a Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.<sup id="cite_ref-Christian_372-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Christian-372"><span>[</span>372<span>]</span></a></sup> He wrote in <i>The Audacity of Hope</i> that he "was not raised in a religious household". He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents (whom Obama has specified elsewhere as "non-practicing <a href="/wiki/Methodist" title="Methodist" class="mw-redirect">Methodists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Baptists" title="Baptists">Baptists</a>"), as being detached from religion, yet "in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known." He described his father as a "confirmed <a href="/wiki/Atheist" title="Atheist" class="mw-redirect">atheist</a>" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as "a man who saw religion as not particularly useful." Obama explained how, through working with <a href="/wiki/Black_church" title="Black church">black churches</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Community_organizing" title="Community organizing">community organizer</a> while in his twenties, he came to understand "the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change."<sup id="cite_ref-social_change_373-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-social_change-373"><span>[</span>373<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In January 2008, Obama told <i><a href="/wiki/Christianity_Today" title="Christianity Today">Christianity Today</a></i>: "I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of <a href="/wiki/Jesus_Christ" title="Jesus Christ" class="mw-redirect">Jesus Christ</a>. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life."<sup id="cite_ref-374" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-374"><span>[</span>374<span>]</span></a></sup> On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying "I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't—frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me."<sup id="cite_ref-APbychoice_375-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-APbychoice-375"><span>[</span>375<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ABCVideobychoice_376-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ABCVideobychoice-376"><span>[</span>376<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
