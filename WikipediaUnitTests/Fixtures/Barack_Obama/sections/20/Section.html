His proposal was to spend $900&#160;billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the <a href="/wiki/Public_health_insurance_option" title="Public health insurance option">public option</a>, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for <a href="/wiki/Pre-existing_condition" title="Pre-existing condition">pre-existing conditions</a>, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.<sup id="cite_ref-214" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-214"><span>[</span>214<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-215" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-215"><span>[</span>215<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional.
